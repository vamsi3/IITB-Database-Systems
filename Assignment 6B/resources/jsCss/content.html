Hello. This div was initially empty but was populated on page load.<br>
The response is processed in Javascript using a callback, to calculate the number
of characters.

<ul>
<li> Click on 'Load table data' to load data into the table using AJAX. </li>
<li> Click on any table row to replace this div with data from that row. </li>
</ul>
